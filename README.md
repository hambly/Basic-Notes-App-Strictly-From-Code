Basic-Notes-App-Strictly-From-Code
==================================

This is an exercise in raw code, no IB, nibs, or storyboards here.

I typically use nibs and storyboard for my apps, so for this app I wanted to try to do it all programmatically while still taking full advantage of auto-layout.

There are quite a few outstanding issues with this app, and in the future I would like to flesh it out to be a bit more functional (swipe gestures are needed!) and sync with reminders or dropbox.
